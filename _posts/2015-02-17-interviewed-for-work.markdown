In my day job at [Modus Create](http://moduscreate.com), we have a weekly 
email newsletter that keeps our distributed team up to date with things 
that are going on around the company.  This features a weekly interview 
with a staff member, in the form of five standard questions.

My turn came around this week, and here it is for a wider audience.  If you like 
this sort of thing, I've found [Workspiration](http://workspiration.org/) to be 
quite an interesting read.

Q. What is your favorite tool and why?
--------------------------------------

I'm a big fan of having the right set of single purpose tools, rather than one that fails at a range of tasks.  This means I generally avoid using IDEs, which has led to me trying out of a lot of different text editors for a range of different programming languages over time.  I'm currently a fan of Sublime Text as it's got a lot of stuff you want in a programmer's text editor (bracket matching, basic language syntax highlighting, good search and replace, block select mode etc) without all of the bloat you see in many other "developer environments" out there.  It's a good core product that you can beef up with optional modules as much or as little as you need for a given set of tasks.

Q.How did you get into development?
-----------------------------------

Brute force and ignorance.  Originally by trying to write simple BASIC games for the ZX Spectrum in the early 1980s, then later 68000 assembler / C for the Amiga/Atari ST era .  Prior to the internet and easy availability of modems and unmetered phone calls in the UK you had to teach yourself -- mostly by reverse engineering existing software or petitioning your local library to get some relevant books in stock.  I did a 4 year CS degree, one year of which was a placement year with a software company - I went to HP Labs UK, and returned to HP Labs (Palo Alto) upon graduation which is how I got started in a professional environment as a C/C++ developer.

I'm currently going back to simple gaming roots with my 12 year old - we're building a Flappy Bird clone that runs on an LED light matrix.  I'm using Python which is a pretty approachable language for kids, and is tightly integrated with optional hardware on the Raspberry Pi.

Q. If you could be any animal, what would you be and why?
---------------------------------------------------------

Probably a Kea (native alpine Parrot only found on New Zealand's South Island)... Kea are self-taught, intelligent, curious, and work as a team.  They're known for feigning injury to get food from tourists, and can pull rubber seals off cars or let air out of tires.

Q. What is one interesting thing about yourself?
------------------------------------------------

I currently hold three driving licenses from three different countries on three different continents: UK, USA, NZ.

Q. What do you do away from your keyboard?
------------------------------------------

I like to travel and have been fortunate in the past to do a round the world working tour delivering training whilst also getting some vacation time in many locations I would not otherwise have thought to visit.  I still have a number of unfulfilled travel goals to complete - would love to visit Japan some day.

I also like to spend time competing in / helping out with grass roots motorsports.  I've not done much with that recently but hope to get back to it soon.  I've taken part in (and helped organize) long distance charity events in old beaters across Europe, rallying on farmland in New Zealand, track days in the UK and cars & coffee social events here.
