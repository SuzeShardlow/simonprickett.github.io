A number of us at work recently signed up for the [hack.pledge()](http://hackpledge.org) 
New Year's Resolution.  In case you're not familiar with it, this is an effort to put 
folks needing coding mentoring in touch with experienced people who can help.  The idea 
is that you give an hour (or more if you like) of coding help, and someone else benefits 
on their learning path.

It is hard to learn to code, and can be frustrating - some people think that the internet's 
helped greatly here as you can Google most things, but often you'll find more questions than 
answers, or religious type debates on the merits of solving a problem one way versus another.

I signed up to mentor as I thought it'd be quite interesting to do, and I miss working in 
training delivery.  You can also sign up as a student if you need to receive help.  Maybe 
you can do both roles - mentor in something you already know about, and learn something else.

If you want to learn more about this initiative, check out the site at 
[hackpledge.org](http://hackpledge.org) and watch their intro video below.

At about the same time as I signed up for this, I was indepdently asked by 
a friend to help them get started working with HTML, CSS and JavaScript and 
decided to give it a go.

We chose to build a small game, because it's a well understood problem, it is 
easy to know when you have something that's working, and heck it might even be 
a bit of fun.  We wanted something easy to understand and explain, so chose 
the basic number guessing game where the computer "thinks" of a number in the 
range 1-100, and the user has to take guesses.  The computer "tells" the user 
after each guess whether they need to guess higher, lower, or have correctly 
determined the secret number.

This turned out to be a decent enough challenge teaching a bit of HTML, a bit 
of JavaScript, some CSS and learning about how the three work together to build 
a modern web application.  We also decided to add some process to the project, 
and introduce [Github](http://github.com) for source control and collaboration.

Both of us learned something from the process, my friend picked up some new 
understanding of how to go about building a webapp and realized that you don't 
have to be a walking syntax reference to get things done (I don't have DOM 
manipulation syntax memorized).  For me, it was fun to revisit some basics and 
remind myself of how they work.

You can try playing our basic game below, or go get the code from 
[the Github repo](https://github.com/simonprickett/jsnumberguess/) and look at
it yourself.  Feel free to laugh as my CSS, it's not my strong suit... maybe an 
area that I could benefit from some mentoring in?
