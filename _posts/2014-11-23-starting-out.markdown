Hi there,

I'm going to try to formalize some of the things I do regularly in my professional life that others might find useful.  Sometimes I might post asking for help, but I hope to be able to contribute some original thought too!

I'm a longtime software professional based in the Washington, D.C. area of the 
United States, but am originally from England via a stint in New Zealand.  I'm 
currently employed as an architect at Modus Create, Reston VA.  

My areas of experience / interest include:

* PhoneGap / Apache Cordova, mostly on iOS and Android
* iOS and Android development
* HTML5, Sencha Touch framework
* Javascript (client and server)
* Java
* C/C++ (I'm slowly trying to write a Nintendo Gameboy Advance game)
* Python (usually as a glue for other things)
* Jenkins Continuous Integration

I do other stuff outside of work too, and you can check that out via Instagram.

If you have any questions, or see anything that could use improvement or is just plain wrong here, get in touch.

Thanks,

Simon.
